I need a dotfiles management system. Desired features of the system:

- A unified config file (probably in YAML format):
    - Accounting custom scripts in ~/.local/bin
    - Accounting configs in ~/.config and other places
    - PATH directories:
        - Generate a zsh file that will be sourced
    - Patches with custom ebuilds and PKGBUILDS with tests (like for "st")
    - Accounting dependencies
- Managing prefixes of various toolchains:
    - Possible solution is to wrap the "modules" tool: https://github.com/cea-hpc/modules
- An installation script:
    - Choose one from multiple parallel configurations for multiple systems/machines
    - Checking for installed dependencies
- Automatic synchronization:
    - Pull newest changes (if they come from other machine, for example)
    - Push changes to the remote repository
    - Check for changes on the remote repository before commit
